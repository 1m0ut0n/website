***This is the source code of my personal website.***

This is where I present myself, my personal and professional experiences.
I also sometimes post blog articles or talk a little about my projects.

## 🛠️ Stack

*This site is built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and is forked from the awesome [astro-nano](https://github.com/markhorn-dev/astro-nano) project made by [Mark Horn](https://github.com/markhorn-dev).*

Thanks to that, it has a perfect Lighthouse score, is really fast, lightweight, and has a lot of neat functionalities.

I modified it to my preferences so that it looks even better!
